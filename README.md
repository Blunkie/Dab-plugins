Open source plugins for the OpenOSRS client. 
Only plugin availble right now is MazeTeleGrab. In its current status is will left click cast telegrab on any NPC so when you are not using it turn it off.
CerbHelper, DKSwapper, and HydraAutoPrayers are currently posted here but won't load into OpenOSRS when you add this repo as they are unfinished. I have them posted here so others can see how I made it enablie on/off via hotkey with an added privacy feature for the widget.
